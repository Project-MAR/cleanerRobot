## cleanerRobot

### Introduction
This project is a part from student project which aim to learn and build a cleaning robot from scratch. Becasue of the budget constraint, this robot must be cheap but easy to build. I try many ways to to help and finally found an idea from [youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhJWnPv7goU&t=622s) so I apply for this project. The result is a cleaning robot which cost about 150$.
